This Board is a modified version of Bucket Mouse's Original DMGC CPU board which houses the majority of the electronics in the DMGC and adds the IR components as well.

Version 2.0 of Bucket Mouse's original design introduced a test pad labelled "RST" that connects directly to the /RESET pin. If this pin is pulled to GND, when it's released then the system will reset back to the boot screen. If you wire this pad to a button that connects the pad to GND when pressed, you basically have added a reset button to your DMGC. 

There are also pads near the FFC connector that are added labelled "PUSH" and "ROCK DOWN". These connect to the rocker switch on the DMGC-IPS-01 board (version 2.0 and later). The PUSH pad becomes connected to GND when the rocker switch is pushed in and floats when not pressed (as long as you remove R10 on the DMGC-IPS-01 board). The ROCK_DOWN pad connects to GND when the rocker switch is rocked down, and floats when not pressed (as long as you remove C5 on the DMGC-IPS-01 board).

In a normal configuration, pushing in on the rocker switch will control the button LEDs, and rocking down will swap the Q5 color settings, but if you don't want to use one of these features, then adding a wire from the PUSH or ROCK DOWN pad to RST pad will turn the rocker switch into a reset button for the system for that specific action and replace its normal function.

**CAUTION: Remember to remove R10 or C5 on the IPS board if you plan to use this feature!!!**
